# Mage
Object-Oriented IDE for Visual Programming Languages 

[Still being designed.] 

The idea at this point is a 2D version of Unity but more like Scratch. It should use visual programming languages so it's easy for beginners. It should teach coding but also organization and structure and concepts like objects, classes, inheritance, parent-child relationships. There should be some sort of visualization of the program running and of the stages of the main loop. The underlying code should also be visible and direct coding should be possible.

Mage will be primarily for game development so there will need to be a built in game engine. Development of the game engine will start with Javascript and HTML5 and only add C# after. The games will be canvas-based. The code editors (scratch blocks and flow charts) will be svg/html page elements. The code should be compiled into XML or JSON and stored (and restored) as such. So a compiler from this XML or JSON format to Javascript and eventually C# source code is also need.

Game Engine Ideas: Got some partial plans but will explain later.

[The Editor is just a concept for the layout, it doesn't do anything at this point.]
